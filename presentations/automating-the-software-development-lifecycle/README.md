## Setup

For the Vagrant environment to work you create a folder called presentations - this folder can be a synlink to the actual presentations folder (see [here](https://github.com/pauby/presentations/tree/master/Automating%20the%20Software%20Deployment%20Lifecycle)). The presentations folder will be shared with the vagrant machine called `presentations` so the demos will be available from there.
